# Meta
- Seems to take an neural net approach instead of a minmax approach 
# Notes
Has only one section covering chess, that of evaluating a chess position, using neurons 
Look into
- McCulloch-Pitts neurons
- Activation functions for chess
# Evaluating a position in a chess game
"The evaluation system can easily be represented with two McCulloch-Pitts neurons, one for black and one for white."
"The sum of both neurons requires an activation function that converts the evaluation into 1/100th of a pawn"
