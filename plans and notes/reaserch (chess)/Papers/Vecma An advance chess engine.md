# Meta
This paper contains several grammatical mistakes. It was either rushed to publication, translated to English from another language or something else has happened. Either way, it may not be the best source.

This idea of using positional vectors is fascinating, however.
# Note
"In many chess engines now-a-days, min-max algorithm is used"

"We also proposed an integration of vector maps, which encourages the engine to play positionally from very early stages. This is done using the vector map of 2D array which contains the heuristic values of every in every position". These pieces show the ideal position for every piece."
